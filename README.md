# Name Tree Project

This project was made for the Data Structures class on my CS graduation.

The goal is to implement a binary search tree able to read names from a file and assemble a proper binary tree.

There is also besides the regular tree operations there is also:
- search by substring
- remove strings smaller than specified string
- remove strings bigger than specified string

The project was already submitted for teacher's avaliation, but since i'm open sourcing it there is still some work to do
in order to be a reasonable and helpful project in my opinion, so I created some issues on the repository in order to acomplish that goal.

Please, feel free to help and contributing to the project and if you wanna talk to me about the project, to give ideas or suggestions to improve you can
